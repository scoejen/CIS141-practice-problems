#1. Construct a truth table for the expression: (A AND B) OR (NOT B) where A and B each can be True or False.
#   Your truth table should be commented out (as it's not valid Python code!)

#  A  and  B       OR      NOT B
#-------------------------------------
# True    True     True      False
# True    False    True      True
# False   False    False     True
# False   True     True      False

#2. The headlights of a car should only automatically turn on when the daylight outside is below a certain threshold.
#   If a sensor threshold is below the number 8, print "Headlights On"; otherwise, print "Headlights Off".

#sensor = 4
#if sensor < 8:
#    print("Healights On")
#else:
#    print("Headlights Off")

#3. Prompt the user for their bank balance. Evaluate whether the balance is less than $100.
#   Print True if the userâ€™s balance is below $100; print False, otherwise.

#bank = float(input("What is your account balance?: "))
#if bank <= 100:
#    print("True")
#else:
#    print("False")

#4. A theater wants to enforce age restrictions for movie tickets. Ask the user for their age,
#   and tell them whether they can see G (appropriate for under 13), PG-13 (appropriate for 13 to 17),
#   or R (appropriate for over 18) rated movies.

#age = int(input("How old are you?: "))
#if age >= 18:
#    print("You can watch R rated movies.")
#elif age >= 13:
#    print("You are cleared for PG-13")
#else:
#    print("You can only watch G rated movies.")

#5. A store charges $5 for shipping on any order under $50. If the order amount is $50 or more, shipping is free.
#   Ask the user for the order total and print the total cost, including shipping.

#order = float(input("How much was your order? $: "))
#if order < 50:
#    cost = order + 5
#    print(f"Your total cost is ${cost:.2f}")
#else:
#    print(f"Your total cost is ${order:.2f}")
