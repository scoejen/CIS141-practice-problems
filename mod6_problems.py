# MODULE 6 PRACTICE PROBLEMS

#1. Given a list of numbers, write code to iterate through the list and calculate the sum of all even numbers.
#   Print the resulting sum.
# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# sum = 0
# for number in numbers:
#    if number % 2 == 0:
#        sum += number
# print(sum)

#2. With a list of strings provided, write code that counts how many times the word "Olympic" appears in the list,
#   and then print the count.
# strings = ["Olympic", "Batman", "Superman", "Wonderwoman", "Olympic", "Flash", "Aquaman"]
# counter = 0
# for string in strings:
#    if string == "Olympic":
#        counter += 1
# print(counter)

#3. Given a list of strings, write code to create a new list that includes only the strings longer than three
#   characters. Print the resulting filtered list.
#strings = ["Iron Man", "Up", "Two", "High", "Spider-Man"]
#new_list = []
#for i in strings:
#    if len(i) > 3:
#        new_list.append(i)
#print(new_list)

#4. For a list of integers, write code that counts how many numbers are positive and how many are negative,
#   then print both counts.
#numbers = [3, 2, 1, -1, -2, -3]
#counter = 0
#for number in numbers:
#    if number <= 0:
#        counter += 1
#        print("There are", negative, " negative numbers.")
#    else:
#        counter += 1
#        print("There are", counter, "positive numbers.")

#5. For a list of integers, use a loop to build a new list where each element is the square of the corresponding
#   element in the original list. Print the new list.
#my_list = [20, 40, 60, 80, 100]
#new_list = []

#for number in my_list:
#    if number > 0:
#        number *= number
#        new_list.append(number)
#
#print(new_list)
